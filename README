These are the scripts needed to run AutoAlign on a single workstation or on a cluster.

It has been cloned to angula:
/home/michael/Scripts/AutoAlign

To compile CAN, make sure the following scripts are in your working directory: 

Adapt.cpp
Adapt.o 
Edge.cpp
Edge.h  
Edge.o  
Node.cpp  
Node.h  
Node.o  
imagic.h  
makefile

Then type 'make' on the command line.

The auto_align_queue script is the wrapper that will run CAN on a Sun Grid Engines cluster whereas auto_align_101013e is the wrapper you need to run CAN on a single linux workstation.
